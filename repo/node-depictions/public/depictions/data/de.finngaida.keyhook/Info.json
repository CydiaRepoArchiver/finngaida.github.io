	"fulldescription": "Android has bluetooth keyboard support built-in since version 2 and with iOS 9 Apple somehow tried to add some features to it as well (cheat sheets, special keybindings), but the homescreen is still not at all listening to keyboard events. With Keyhook a subtle selection view appears behind the icons that you can control with the arrow keys. Use <enter> to open the currently selected app/folder, ⌘ + <arrow> to swipe pages and ⌘ + [1-9] to access your apps in the dock.",
